# economic-events-webscraper

BS4 webscraper to pull economic events from investing.com

This is a sample project that only scrape today's economic events. The full project will webscrape historical and future economic events.

Currently the script is designed to install all requirements (pandas, arrow, bs4, etc) and will do so each time it is run. This code can be commented out if you do not wish to schedule the script.
